  abstract={Multi-signatures enable a group of t signers to sign a message jointly and obtain a single signature. Multi-signatures help validating blockchain transactions, such as transactions with multiple inputs or transactions from multisig addresses. However, multi-signatures schemes are always realised naively in most blockchain systems by directly concatenating t ECDSA signatures.
    In this paper, we give the first multi-signature scheme for ECDSA. Technically, we design a new ephemeral group public key for the set of signers and introduce an interactive signing protocol to output a single ECDSA signature. The signature can be validated by the ephemeral group public key. Then, we instantiate the ECDSA multi-signature scheme with class group, for which we design a secret exchanging mechanism that ensures the hiding content is well-constructed. Moreover, our scheme is able to identify the malicious party in the signing phase and help to minimize unnecessary resource consumption. This ECDSA multi-signatures can be used in blockchain to reduce the transaction cost and provide accountability for signers and backward compatibility with existing ECDSA addresses.

  abstract={User attributes can be authenticated by an attribute-based anonymous credential while keeping the anonymity of the user.
    Most attribute-based anonymous credential schemes are designed specifically for either multi-use or single-use.
    In this paper, we propose a unified attribute-based anonymous credential system, in which
    users always obtain the same format of credential from the issuer. The user can choose to use it for an efficient multi-use or single-use show proof. It is a more user-centric approach than the existing schemes.
    Technically, we propose an interactive approach to the credential issuance protocol using a two-party computation with an additive homomorphic encryption. 
    At the same time, it keeps the security property of impersonation resilience, anonymity, and unlinkability.
    Apart from the interactive protocol, we further design the show proofs for efficient single-use credentials which maintain the user anonymity.
