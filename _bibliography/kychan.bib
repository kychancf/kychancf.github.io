  abstract={Public data can be authenticated by obtaining from a trustworthy website with TLS. Private data, such as user profile, are usually restricted from public access. If a user wants to authenticate his private data (e.g., address) provided by a restricted website (e.g., user profile page of a utility company website) to a verifier, he cannot simply give his username and password to the verifier. DECO (CCS 2020) provides a solution for liberating these data without introducing undesirable trust assumption, nor requiring server-side modification. Their implementation is mainly based on TLS 1.2.
  In this paper, we propose an optimized solution for TLS 1.3 websites. We tackle a number of open problems, including the support of X25519 key exchange in TLS 1.3, the design of round-optimal three-party key exchange, the architecture of two-party computation of TLS 1.3 key scheduling, and circuit design optimized for two-party computation. We test our implementation with real world website and show that our optimization is necessary to avoid timeout in TLS handshake.

  abstract={In most threshold Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signatures using additively homomorphic encryption, 
  the zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs related to the ciphertext or the message space are the bottleneck in terms of bandwidth as well as computation time. 
  In this paper, we propose a compact ZK proof for relations related to the Castagnos-Laguillaumie (CL) encryption, 
  which is 33% shorter and 29% faster than the existing work in PKC 2021. We also give new ZK proofs for relations related to homomorphic operations over the CL ciphertext. 
  These new ZK proofs are useful to construct a bandwidth-efficient universal composable-secure threshold ECDSA without compromising the proactive security and the non-interactivity. 
  In particular, we lowered the communication and computation cost of the key refresh algorithm in the Paillier-based counterpart from O(n^3) to O(n^2). 
  Considering a 5-signer setting, the bandwidth is better than the Paillier-based counterpart for up to 99, 95 and 35% for key generation, key refreshment and pre-signing, respectively.},

  abstract={Multi-signatures enable a group of t signers to sign a message jointly and obtain a single signature. Multi-signatures help validating blockchain transactions, such as transactions with multiple inputs or transactions from multisig addresses. However, multi-signatures schemes are always realised naively in most blockchain systems by directly concatenating t ECDSA signatures.
    In this paper, we give the first multi-signature scheme for ECDSA. Technically, we design a new ephemeral group public key for the set of signers and introduce an interactive signing protocol to output a single ECDSA signature. The signature can be validated by the ephemeral group public key. Then, we instantiate the ECDSA multi-signature scheme with class group, for which we design a secret exchanging mechanism that ensures the hiding content is well-constructed. Moreover, our scheme is able to identify the malicious party in the signing phase and help to minimize unnecessary resource consumption. This ECDSA multi-signatures can be used in blockchain to reduce the transaction cost and provide accountability for signers and backward compatibility with existing ECDSA addresses.

  abstract={User attributes can be authenticated by an attribute-based anonymous credential while keeping the anonymity of the user.
    Most attribute-based anonymous credential schemes are designed specifically for either multi-use or single-use.
    In this paper, we propose a unified attribute-based anonymous credential system, in which
    users always obtain the same format of credential from the issuer. The user can choose to use it for an efficient multi-use or single-use show proof. It is a more user-centric approach than the existing schemes.
    Technically, we propose an interactive approach to the credential issuance protocol using a two-party computation with an additive homomorphic encryption. 
    At the same time, it keeps the security property of impersonation resilience, anonymity, and unlinkability.
    Apart from the interactive protocol, we further design the show proofs for efficient single-use credentials which maintain the user anonymity.
