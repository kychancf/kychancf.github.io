  abstract={Background: The chatbot application Bennie and the Chats was introduced due to the outbreak of COVID-19, which is aimed to provide substitution for teaching conventional clinical history-taking skills. It was implemented with DialogFlow with preset responses, which consists of a large constraint on responding to different conversations. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, such as the recent introduction of ChatGPT, offers innovative conversational experiences with computer-generated responses. It provides an idea to develop the second generation of Bennie and the Chats. As the epidemic slows, it can become an assisting tool for students as additional exercise. In this work, we present the second generation of Bennie and the Chats with ChatGPT, which provides room for flexible and expandable improvement. Methods: The objective of this research is to examine the influence of the newly proposed chatbot on learning efficacy and experiences in bedside teaching, and its potential contributions to international teaching collaboration. This study employs a mixed-method design that incorporates both quantitative and qualitative approaches. From the quantitative approach, we launched the world’s first cross-territory virtual bedside teaching with our proposed application and conducted a survey between the University of Hong Kong (HKU) and the National University of Singapore (NUS). Descriptive statistics and Spearman’s Correlation were applied for data analysis. From the qualitative approach, a comparative analysis was conducted between the two versions of the chatbot. And, we discuss the interrelationship between the quantitative and qualitative results. Results: For the quantitative result, we collected a questionnaire from 45 students about the evaluation of virtual bedside teaching between territories. Over 75% of the students agreed that teaching can enhance learning effectiveness and experience. Moreover, by exchanging patients cases, 82.2% of students agreed that it helps to gain more experiences with diseases that may not be prevalent in their own locality. For the qualitative result, the new chatbot provides better usability and flexibility. Conclusion: Virtual bedside teaching with chatbots has revolutionized conventional bedside teaching by its advantages and allowing international collaborations. We believe that the training of history taking skills by chatbot will be a feasible supplementary teaching tool to conventional bedside teaching.}

  abstract={Multi-party private set intersection (mPSI) securely enables multiple parties to know the intersection of their sets without disclosing anything else. Many mPSI protocols are not efficient in practice. In this paper, we propose two efficient mPSI protocols that are secure against an arbitrary number of colluding parties. In the protocol O-Ring, we take advantage of the ring network topology such that the communication costs of the party with the largest workload can be cheaper than other mPSI protocols with a star topology. In the protocol K-Star, we take advantage of the star topology to support better concurrency such that the protocol can run fast. K-Star is suitable for applications with a powerful centralized server. Different from KMPRT (CCS'17) and CDGOSS (CCS'21) that rely on Oblivious Programmable PRF primitive, we simply utilize the cheaper Oblivious PRF (OPRF) and a data structure Oblivious Key-value Store (OKVS). We further propose two fine-grained optimizations for OKVS and OPRF in multi-party cases to improve runtime performance.
  After extensive experiments, we demonstrate that both protocols run the fastest and achieve the lowest total communication costs compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts in most settings. Specifically, O-Ring/K-Star is respectively 1.6x - 48.3x and 4.0x - 39.8x (except one setting) cheaper than KMPRT (CCS'17) and CDGOSS (CCS'21) in the total communication costs. For the total running time, K-Star can be respectively 1.4x - 9.0x and 1.0x - 15.3x as fast as them in the LAN setting.}

  abstract={Chameleon hash (CH) function differs from a classical hash function in a way that a collision can be found with the knowledge of a trapdoor secret key. CH schemes have been used in various cryptographic applications such as sanitizable signatures and redactable blockchains. In this work, we reconstruct CH to ensure advanced security and usability. Our contributions are four-fold. First, we propose the first CH scheme, which supports full security, meaning the inclusion of both full indistinguishability and full collision-resistance. These two properties are required in the strongest CH security model in the literature. We achieve this by our innovative design of removing the CH public key during the computation of the hash value. 
  Second, we investigate the security of CH in the multi-party setting and introduce the new properties of claimability and deniability under this setting. Third, we present and implement two instantiations of our CH scheme: an ECC-based one and a post-quantum lattice-based one. Our implementation demonstrates their practicality. Finally, we discuss the possible use cases in the blockchain.}

  abstract={Threshold ECDSA receives interest lately due to its widespread adoption in blockchain applications. A common building block of all leading constructions involves a secure conversion of multiplicative shares into additive ones, which is called the multiplicative-to-additive (MtA) function.  MtA dominates the overall complexity of all existing threshold ECDSA constructions. Specifically, O(n^2)invocations of MtA are required in the case of n active signers. Hence, improvement of MtA leads directly to significant improvements for all state-of-the-art threshold ECDSA schemes. 
  In this paper, we design a novel MtA by revisiting the Joye-Libert (JL) cryptosystem. Specifically, we revisit JL encryption and propose a JL-based commitment, then give efficient zero-knowledge proofs for JL cryptosystem which are the first to have standard soundness. Our new MtA offers the best time-space complexity trade-off among all existing  MtA constructions. It outperforms state-of-the-art constructions from Paillier by a factor of 1.82 to 2 in bandwidth and 1.2 to 1.7 in computation. It is 7x faster than those based on Castagnos-Laguillaumie encryption only at the cost of 2x more bandwidth. While our MtA is slower than OT-based constructions, it saves 18.7x in bandwidth requirement. In addition, we also design a batch version of MtA to further reduce the amotised time and space cost by another 25%.}

  abstract={Public data can be authenticated by obtaining from a trustworthy website with TLS. Private data, such as user profile, are usually restricted from public access. If a user wants to authenticate his private data (e.g., address) provided by a restricted website (e.g., user profile page of a utility company website) to a verifier, he cannot simply give his username and password to the verifier. DECO (CCS 2020) provides a solution for liberating these data without introducing undesirable trust assumption, nor requiring server-side modification. Their implementation is mainly based on TLS 1.2.
  In this paper, we propose an optimized solution for TLS 1.3 websites. We tackle a number of open problems, including the support of X25519 key exchange in TLS 1.3, the design of round-optimal three-party key exchange, the architecture of two-party computation of TLS 1.3 key scheduling, and circuit design optimized for two-party computation. We test our implementation with real world website and show that our optimization is necessary to avoid timeout in TLS handshake.

  abstract={In most threshold Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signatures using additively homomorphic encryption, 
  the zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs related to the ciphertext or the message space are the bottleneck in terms of bandwidth as well as computation time. 
  In this paper, we propose a compact ZK proof for relations related to the Castagnos-Laguillaumie (CL) encryption, 
  which is 33% shorter and 29% faster than the existing work in PKC 2021. We also give new ZK proofs for relations related to homomorphic operations over the CL ciphertext. 
  These new ZK proofs are useful to construct a bandwidth-efficient universal composable-secure threshold ECDSA without compromising the proactive security and the non-interactivity. 
  In particular, we lowered the communication and computation cost of the key refresh algorithm in the Paillier-based counterpart from O(n^3) to O(n^2). 
  Considering a 5-signer setting, the bandwidth is better than the Paillier-based counterpart for up to 99, 95 and 35% for key generation, key refreshment and pre-signing, respectively.},

  abstract={Multi-signatures enable a group of t signers to sign a message jointly and obtain a single signature. Multi-signatures help validating blockchain transactions, such as transactions with multiple inputs or transactions from multisig addresses. However, multi-signatures schemes are always realised naively in most blockchain systems by directly concatenating t ECDSA signatures.
    In this paper, we give the first multi-signature scheme for ECDSA. Technically, we design a new ephemeral group public key for the set of signers and introduce an interactive signing protocol to output a single ECDSA signature. The signature can be validated by the ephemeral group public key. Then, we instantiate the ECDSA multi-signature scheme with class group, for which we design a secret exchanging mechanism that ensures the hiding content is well-constructed. Moreover, our scheme is able to identify the malicious party in the signing phase and help to minimize unnecessary resource consumption. This ECDSA multi-signatures can be used in blockchain to reduce the transaction cost and provide accountability for signers and backward compatibility with existing ECDSA addresses.

  abstract={User attributes can be authenticated by an attribute-based anonymous credential while keeping the anonymity of the user.
    Most attribute-based anonymous credential schemes are designed specifically for either multi-use or single-use.
    In this paper, we propose a unified attribute-based anonymous credential system, in which
    users always obtain the same format of credential from the issuer. The user can choose to use it for an efficient multi-use or single-use show proof. It is a more user-centric approach than the existing schemes.
    Technically, we propose an interactive approach to the credential issuance protocol using a two-party computation with an additive homomorphic encryption. 
    At the same time, it keeps the security property of impersonation resilience, anonymity, and unlinkability.
    Apart from the interactive protocol, we further design the show proofs for efficient single-use credentials which maintain the user anonymity.
